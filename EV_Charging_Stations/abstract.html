    <h2>The Charge Forward: A Narrative on Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure in New York City</h2>
    <h4>A Project by Chris Cali</h4>
    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is gaining momentum across the US with the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act and recent commitments by municipal governments. Access to EV charging stations is crucial to ensure a smooth rollout. With that said, the task of providing access to charging stations is more challenging in cities like New York where many individuals live in apartment complexes or public housing. This narrative visualization project examines the distribution of EV charging stations in New York City and explores the relationship between the location of charging stations and demographic data from the census. The project uses data from the Department of Energy to create a layered map of charging station locations, overlaid with demographic information for each zip code. This map will help to determine whether there is an equitable distribution of charging stations across the city and identify areas that are lacking in EV infrastructure. The project will also include tooltips with information for each area and charging station and a bar chart showing the amount of charging stations in each area of NYC. By highlighting areas that are impacted and examining the relationship between charging stations and demographic data, this project aims to contribute to the ongoing discussions around equitable access to EV infrastructure.</p>
