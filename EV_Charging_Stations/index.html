              <p>The future of vehicular travel is rapidly moving towards electric-powered vehicles, thanks to a surge of interest and investment in sustainable transportation. The US government is actively supporting this transition through various incentives and regulations with the recent passing of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill and Inflation Reduction Act. Among these initiatives is an aim to build a national network of 500,000 EV chargers across America's highways and communities. A recent press release by the Biden-Harris administration sets a goal of making EVs (electric vehicles) account for at least 50% of new car sales by 2030.

              <p>In New York City, the focus of this project, the local government is also taking steps to increase the uptake of EVs. Mayor Eric Adams recently announced at his State of the City Address that Uber and Lyft will be required to be zero-emission by 2030, affecting an estimated 100,000 for-hire vehicles. Both Uber and Lyft are in support of this initiative. The city's Department of Transportation (DOT) is also building its own network of EV charging stations, including fast chargers, Level 2 chargers, and curbside charge points, with plans to equip 20% of all spaces in municipal public parking lots and garages with level 2 chargers by 2025. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is also transitioning to a zero-emission bus fleet by 2040.</p>

            <div class="chargersP">
              <p>It's important to note that there are three different types of EV charging stations: Level 1, Level 2, and DC Fast Charging. Level 1 chargers take over 24 hours to provide a full charge, which makes them impractical for most purposes; Level 2 chargers provide a full charge in about 8 hours. DC Fast Chargers are the fastest option, taking 60-90 minutes for a full charge. For this analysis, we will focus on Level 2 and DC Fast Chargers since Level 1 chargers are inefficient.</p>

            <div class="prefaceP">
              <p>To better understand the EV charging landscape in NYC, I bring together Department of Energy Data on publicly available EV charging stations and census data. With this information, we can identify areas that are underserved by EV charging infrastructure and make potential recommendations for equitable development.</p>
