              <h2>The Charge Forward: A Narrative on Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure in New York City</h2>

              <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is gaining momentum across the US with the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act and recent commitments by municipal governments. Access to EV charging stations is crucial to ensure a smooth rollout. With that said, the task of providing access to charging stations is more challenging in cities like New York where many individuals live in apartment complexes or public housing. This narrative visualization project examines the distribution of EV charging stations in New York City and explores the relationship between the location of charging stations and demographic data from the census. The project uses data from the Department of Energy to create a layered map of charging station locations, overlaid with demographic information for each neighborhood in NYC. This map will help to determine whether there is an equitable distribution of charging stations across the city and identify areas that are lacking in EV infrastructure. By highlighting areas that are impacted and examining the relationship between charging stations and demographic data, this project aims to contribute to the ongoing discussions around equitable access to EV infrastructure.</p>
            <p><strong>Note on the Data Sets Used:</strong> I used the Department of Energy Data Set on <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest" target="blank">Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations</a> in New York State. I then further cleaned the data sert in Excel removing all non-NYC locations (by zip code). For the Census data, I wanted median household income, race data, and education level information. The NYC Department of City Planning had already created <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/planning-level/nyc-population/american-community-survey.page" target="blank">their own data sets</a> that had information from the American Community Survey (ACS) by Neighborhood Tabulation Area. I pulled the relevant columns from those data sets and joined them to get the demographic data I wanted for the map. Since the Census data was going to be by Neighborhood, I pulled the polygons from NYC Open Data so that they could be drawn.</p>

              <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>As a part of the DATA 73200 course, we were given a data set of US Heat Extremes. The map here features the different locations where important temperature changes were recorded. The size of the points show how large the changes were, while the color indicates a positive or negative change. This type of visualization is important to demonstrate the direction the country is going, especially as we are at risk for extreme natural threats due to climate change.</p>
              <p><strong>Changes & Reflection: </strong>There are two large changes that were made in this visualization from the initial submission. First, I used color to indicate the direction of the temperature change. Second, I added a tooltip so the user could see what the actual temperature change is. This presented me with a few challenges, but I was able to reproduce the type of tooltip I did with my final project on electric vehicle charging stations. For the color changes, I needed to use an if statement based on the value of the temperature change.</p>

              <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Olympics are a global sporting event that brings together athletes from around the world in the spirit of healthy competition. It has grown to become one of the most important sporting events in the world, with many countries participating and striving to win gold medals. To visualize the historical data on Olympic gold medals and participation, a scatter plot was created with Olympic gold medal count on the Y axis, Olympic participation on the X axis, and total silver as the radius of circles. The data, from Kaggle, spans from 1896 to the present day. Overall, the Olympics is an important event that promotes healthy competition, sportsmanship, and international cooperation. The scatter plot offers a fun and informative way to visualize the historical data on Olympic performance, and it serves as a reminder of the importance of the Olympics to the world.</p>
              <p><strong>Note on the Data Sets Used:</strong> I used a data set from Kaggle that has <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/surajjha101/countries-olympics-medals-since-1896?resource=download" target="blank">information Olympic medals and participation from 1896.</a> I very much enjoy the olympics, especially the summer games, so I was excited to get to visualize this data set. I did have to make one modification to the US and Soviet Union medals. Since they both had numbers that exceeded 1,000, I had to remove the comma because the number was not reading in properly.</p>
